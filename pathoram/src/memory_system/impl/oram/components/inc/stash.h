/**
 * @class Stash
 * @brief Temporary storage structure used by the ORAM controller to hold data blocks during accesses.
 *
 * The element type stored is a BlockHeader entry, which represent the entire bucket.
 *  
 * The `Stash` class models a bounded temporary buffer that stores data blocks
 * which cannot yet be written back to the ORAM tree due to path constraints.
 * It supports insertion, removal, remapping of leaves, indexed access,
 * and provides occupancy statistics useful for analyzing ORAM behavior.
 *
 * The stash is internally implemented as an `unordered_map` where:
 * Key (`Addr_t`) is the blockâ€™s address (the program address).
 * Value (`int`) is the associated leaf node in the ORAM tree.
 *
 * Typical usage includes adding blocks after reads, holding them until a suitable
 * writeback slot becomes available on the path, and then removing them.
 *
 * @note The stash enforces a maximum size, beyond which no further entries can be added.
