/**
 * @class ORAMController
 * @brief The main ORAM controller responsible for managing all subcomponents and data flow.
 *
 * The ORAMController is the core manager of ORAM operations. It contains
 * the Stash, Position Map, Access Logic, a Finite State Machine for each request,
 * a table of pending memory transactions, and a reference to the Out-of-Band ORAM structure.
 * 
 * Whenever a request is received from the CPU, it is enqueued in the transaction table.
 * If no other transactions are currently being executed, the next one in line is selected.
 * 
 * It handles remapping operations and ensures consistency between data structures.
 *
 * @note This controller can be extended for further improvements.
